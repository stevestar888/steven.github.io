subtitle: Here's why you'd want to become friends with me!
---

My name is Steven Xu and I am currently a student at Bowdoin College studying Computer Science, while staying engaged in the breadth of the Liberal Arts curriculum. My time in college has been marked by developing a deeper grasp of the complexities of this world, as well as find out what I want to do next.

The answer, as I found, lies at the intersection of Software Engineering and Finance. I am immensely grateful and ecstatic to say I will be starting a role as an Associate Software Engineer in Morningstar’s two-year rotational development program this summer. I will always seek to go where my curiosity points—this is what my Liberal Arts education has taught me. I want to apply what I’ve learned into initiatives that are impactful, innovative, and put the consumer-experience first, and I believe I will find that at Morningstar. 

I'd be glad to connect, no matter who or where you are! My Calendly link is in the footer if you want to set up a time to chat; otherwise, I’m on LinkedIn as well. Feel free to reach out!
