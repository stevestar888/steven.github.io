It’s said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and I believe I just took my last step. Today, I formally accepted a job at Morningstar.

So it turns out, the folks at the Career Exploration and Development were right: a Liberal Arts education can really land you a job anywhere. And, just to clarify, it’s Morningstar, the financial services company, not Morningstar Farms (a division of the Kellogg), Morningstar Express (a delivery service I assume?) or the many dozens of other companies with the same name. 

Come summer, I will be moving out to Chicago to join the two-year Morningstar Development Program (MDP) on the Technology track (the other track is Business). All of the so-called “Tech MDPs” start as Associate Software Engineers, and after 2-3 rotations, we’ll end up anywhere from Front-end to Back-end, QAs to PMs, to even managers.

In preparation for the final interviews on super day, I wrote this in my prep Google Doc:

{: .box-note}
“For as long as I can remember, I was interested in technology: how it’s built, how it works, how each of the parts interact with each other. And more recently, I’ve gotten interested in investing: I’ve was really blown away by the concept of exponential compounding…”

I probably mentioned something like that in all four interviews—and for good reason. Morningstar was founded by Joe Mansueto in 1984 because he saw average, non-Wall Street folks really lacked good financial resources. Granted, I wasn’t even born then, so I can’t bear witness to how it was like to invest back then (I’m pretty sure you either sent a letter or called your broker to make a trade… with a fee, of course). I can say that even now—with a plethora of free, educational financial content online—Morningstar still continues to empower investors by equipping them with insights that lead to more informed investment decisions.

As a Tech MDP at Morningstar, I believe I would be uniquely situated in a role that allows me to grow technically, and in a field that I am passionate about. In the finance space, Morningstar really has an incredible market presence, and I plan to learn as much as I can. There are a lot persons, places, and things I want to thank, but I really do credit Bowdoin and my intern friend for this opportunity. Simply put, Bowdoin has just been conducive to learning new ideas and meeting new people. As for you, my good intern friend, I know you referred me to Robinhood so you could get a free stock, but you have no idea how much I appreciate this new world that's opened up.

2020 will surely be an unforgettable year, with mountain highs and Mariana Trench lows, but today… well, today I’ve sealed one remnant of 2020 by becoming Morningstar’s next employee.
