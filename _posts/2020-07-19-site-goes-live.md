"Hello World", my friend! Do you like this new Haiku? But first, a story.

## A Quick Story
One time, back at college (before the pandemic), I was talking with a good friend. She recently wrote an article on a pop culture topic for a publication on campus. Although I normally would glance over an article about that topic, here I knew the author so it read (not necessarily understood) the article. It was honestly really well written and her passion was palpable—and that’s exactly what I told her when I saw her next. She thanked me for the encouragement, but what I didn’t except was that she then said, “yeah, writing papers can become a drag, but writing for fun is… well fun.” In the moment, I wasn’t sure how to respond. I resonated with what she said—yes—but it made me think when the last time I wrote just to write? All the writing I’ve done in my life has been for some purpose. Sorry friend, I didn’t have anything constructive to say back.

Well, that brings us till now. I first set up this website/blog in July 2020, but now it’s half a year later in 2020 when I’m actually writing something concrete. Back then, I was hard on the leetcode grind, so I was probably thinking of posting those unique/fun solutions that I came up with, but I don’t think that’s really necessary anymore. However, I do have high hopes that a good looking website—that is entirely mine MWHAHAHA—will inspire me to jot down some thoughts. They may not be well formed, but I will have at least one reader, and if it informs that one person and makes them think more introspectively about their life, then that’s good enough for me. 

That one person…? It’s me.

## Disclosure
This website is powered by GitHub Pages using the [beautiful jekyll theme](https://beautifuljekyll.com). So that's right, I didn't code a frontend or backend, I didn't use a webserver. I’m only techy enough to know how to use other people’s creations, and that’s good enough for me. Funny enough, I did make one [contribution to to the official jekyll repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/8306/commits/05479c6796ec1510e7f8b83a9faf5f1f4ee31986). (You'll never guess what the fix is lol.)
