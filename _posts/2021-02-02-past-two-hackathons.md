Here is what some friends and I made during the last two hackathons. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs honest work.‚Äù 

## Google Power Search (June 2020 during Hack the Northeast)
Nearly everyone uses Google to search the web, but there are actually some advanced operators you can use to further refine your search. For example, putting `filetype:pdf` after your query will yield you results that are only PDFs. Similarly, putting `‚Äúadobe flash‚Äù` after your query will show results that explicitly have ‚Äúadobe flash‚Äù. So, in essence, we built a GUI that lets you use the advanced operators without having to remember them.

As you type in the text boxes / select a filetype, your Google search string is automatically generated. So, then, click the colorful search icon or press enter. While we didn‚Äôt include all operators, I think we covered most of the frequently used ones. Now, because I‚Äôm more familiar with the search operators, I‚Äôll just manually type `filetype:pdf`, `‚Äúadobe flash‚Äù`, or `site:reddit.com` because it rolls off the hand, but I find myself circling back to this for more involved searches.

## Bowdoin "Fun" Menu (February 2021 during Texas A&M‚Äôs hackathon)
Here, we realized there wasn‚Äôt enough ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù in the dining hall menu display space, so we took a stab at building something better. Originally, my idea was we‚Äôd pull the menu off Bowdoin‚Äôs website every day and you could sign up to get alerts if [food] was on the menu. You could choose to get a sms or email notification telling you which dining hall and which meal. We didn‚Äôt end doing this. 

Instead, we made our own display and added a feature to ‚Äúget a fun meal,‚Äù which just randomly chooses a food from each food category üòÇ! The hardest part was actually trying to reverse engineer the menu API. At first, we were going to scrape the website, but Josh found a file literally called `dining-menu.js` and it sent a post request to a specific url. All we had to do was figure out the parameters, which was a bunch of educated guess-and-check.

Current dining hall menu page:

Our attempt (we tried to make it look like the menu was actually printed out with real tabs on the left):

Only Bowdoin '20 - '23 will know why Patrick Dempsey is here üëÄ üåö

## Bowdoin Facility Hours (Spring 2020 for the Human-Computer Interaction class)
After doing a bunch of brainstorming and needfinding, we found our technical abilities and peoples‚Äô needs intersected at a web app that acts as one central place to find hours for common Bowdoin facilities. We found many people, to find the hours for a building, would search ‚ÄúBowdoin [facility] hours‚Äù. If, instead, they had our site bookmarked, finding the hours would take fewer steps and should be faster as well.

In hindsight, HCI was a really cool class. And you learn so much practical Front-end developer knowledge‚Ä¶
